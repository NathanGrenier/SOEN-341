  <section>
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Reservation Policy</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      To book a driving experience, clients are required to make a reservation
      in advance. Reservations can be made through our website, by phone, or in
      person at our locations. Clients are encouraged to book as early as
      possible to ensure availability of their preferred dates and vehicles.

  <section>
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      We understand that plans can change. Clients may cancel their reservations
      without penalty up to 30 days before the scheduled experience.
      Cancellations made 15-29 days before the scheduled experience will incur a
      50% cancellation fee. Unfortunately, cancellations made within 14 days of
      the scheduled experience cannot be refunded. However, clients may choose
      to reschedule their experience for another date within 12 months of the
      original booking, subject to availability.

  <section>
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Insurance Policy</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Safety is our top priority at DriveXperience. All our experiences include
      comprehensive insurance to cover damage to the vehicles and third-party
      liability. However, clients are responsible for a deductible in the event
      of damage. The deductible amount varies depending on the vehicle selected
      and is detailed in the reservation process. Clients are encouraged to
      review the insurance policy details before finalizing their booking.

| Point | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | The TA recommended the team to have more than six user stories to enrich the project's scope and functionality.                                                                                 |
| 2     | It was determined that epics would not be made within the scope of our project.                                                                                                                 |
| 3     | The team agreed that the number of commits should be balanced when nearing the end of the project to ensure equitable contribution.                                                             |
| 4     | Subtasks should include references to the corresponding user story in their titles (e.g., "Subtask of User Story \#X").                                                                         |
| 5     | The syntax provided by the teacher for user stories must be strictly enforced.                                                                                                                  |
| 6     | Acceptance criteria for user stories should be contextual and not strictly related to continuous integration or continuous feedback.                                                            |
| 7     | Referencing operations related to other user stories is acceptable, particularly on an implementation level, without needing to analyze dependencies.                                           |
| 8     | Activities completed during the first sprint will require logged hours.                                                                                                                         |
| 9     | It was decided to have a Sprint 1 folder containing all necessary documents for the sprint, including meeting minutes and an activity log detailing time spent by each member on each activity. |
| 10    | Subissues do not require elaborate descriptions; they only need to be created and linked to the corresponding user story.                                                                       |

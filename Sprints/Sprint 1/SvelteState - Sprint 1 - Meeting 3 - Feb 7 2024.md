| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | David requested the team members to explain the user stories they have written and to elaborate on the tasks they could.                                                                         |
| 2     | Brian explained the user story he wrote regarding the operations that can be done on reservations through the scope of the website user.                                                         |
| 3     | Discuss with the TA if we have to redo a user story that we already worked on in advance, or completely remove it and re-write it for the next sprint.                                           |
| 4     | David explained the user story he wrote regarding the operations that can be done by all three scopes (CSR, customer, and Sysadmin).                                                             |
| 5     | Jeremy explained the user story he wrote regarding the customer's ability to browse vehicles that should be available to rent.                                                                   |
| 6     | Annabel and Nathan have not written their user stories yet, but have explained that they will have something minimal done by Friday for further TA clarification.                                |
| 7     | The team discussed how to link sub-issues to user stories on our GitHub repository. The approach is to convert checkbox items in a user story into GitHub issues, which can then be checked off. |
| 8     | It was decided that issue items will only be created from story items, not from issues themselves.                                                                                               |
| 9     | Team members are assigned the task, to be completed by Friday, of creating individual tasks for their respective user stories.                                                                   |

### Progress Report

- Brian has completed the majority of the authentication functionality, but has
  declared that resetting/changing user credentials is currently outside the
  scope of the sprint.

- Annabel plans to start working on a basic Home Page for the website and aims
  to complete it by the end of the week.

- David has provided development guidelines concerning commit equality,
  dependency management, and linking between front-end, back-end, and middle-end
  components.

- Nirav has introduced a spreadsheet outlining all project requirements and
  their dependencies, with an option for visualization using a node-based graph.

### Problems Encountered

- The other team members have not yet started working on their user stories.

### Sharing of Information

- Annabel and Jeremy will have a call to discuss the color palette and common UI
  components to be used.

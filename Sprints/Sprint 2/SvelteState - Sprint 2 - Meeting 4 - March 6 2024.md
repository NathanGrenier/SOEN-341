### Progress Report

- Annabel will have a home page ready by Friday.

- The merge can be done on the weekend.

- Nathan could make some modals to display some placeholder reservations.

- On the home page of the client, show some reservations with a cancellation
  functionality, should be feasible.

- David and Nirav will make a UI and functionality to start a reservation,
  vehicles, users.

- David and Nirav will make a UI for CRUD Reservations/Customers/Vehicles.

- Set up a Discord Bot that asks users for their status update (problems
  encountered).

- Deliverables for Friday include Home Page, Viewing Reservations on Home Page
  and Cancellation, Viewing Vehicles Page, and merging auth feature PR to main.

- For the incoming user stories, Jeremy will be writing the check-in process,
  and Annabel will be doing the rest.

### Problems Encountered

- Jeremy showed what a "View Vehicles" page could look like, but he hasn't been
  able to make Skeleton work.

### Sharing of Information

- Gonna have to show each branch separately; Auth branch can be merged.

- When not signed in, the regular home page is shown. When signed in, the client
  dashboard will be shown.

- You should be able to modify reservation, but for this sprint we won't have
  that.

- We can have a branch-specific filter when viewing vehicles.

- Need to make sure how to actually implement the acceptance tests in an issue.

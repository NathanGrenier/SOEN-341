### Progress Report

- The team reviewed sprint instructions.

### Problems Encountered

- Impersonation functionality will not be implemented; only login will be.

- Old migrations in Prisms require dropping and recreating tables; main
  migration table should be deleted.

- David expressed concerns regarding task delegation and whether multiple
  stories can be assigned to the same person.

### Sharing of Information

- A stateless session cookie will be used for login functionality.

- Wireframes were deemed important as they provide a reference for developers;
  they should be created first.

- Wireframes precede the implementation of the page's interface.

- Each page should have its own URL to prevent merge conflicts.

- Home page shown when not logged in; dashboard shown when logged in; wireframes
  for both should be created.

- Sign-in required for booking; browsing vehicles allowed without login.

- Car details page to be displayed when viewing more information on a vehicle.

- Settings and "Change my Password" accessible from the sidebar menu.

- Backend tasks, including login, reservation, and CRUD operations, assigned to
  Brian and Nathan.

- Frontend tasks assigned to Annabel and Jeremy.

- David and Nirav to assist in linking backend and frontend instead of handling
  placeholder query construction.

- Next sprint features to be determined after completing six user stories or the
  last week of the sprint.

- Consideration of using an API for reading maps.

- Exploration of Vercel's image storing capabilities planned.

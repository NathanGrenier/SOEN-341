### Progress Report

- The team has successfully implemented the main core features of the web
  application, including a user dashboard, an admin dashboard, the ability to
  browse vehicles and to successfully book a reservation.

- Brian has also finished implementing the check-in and check-out features for a
  customer service representative to perform when a client comes into a branch
  location to pick-up their car rental.

- David and Nathan their features, specifically the system administrator
  dashboard and the user reservation dashboard, respectively. The CRUD
  implementation was re-wired to not use an exposed /api/ route but rather form
  actions that make use of the Fetch API.

- Nirav and Jeremy added filters to the browse-vehicles page and Nirav also
  implemented a find-a-branch feature enabling users to use an interactive map
  to locate branch locations.

- Annabel implemented a few landing pages detailing a contact-us page and a
  policies page. The actual content of the page will need to be re-visited.

### Problems Encountered

- The Vercel Blob storage exceeded its free-tier plan before the TA
  demonstration, we will, for the time-being, be using the URLs of photos in
  pre-existing locations on the Internet.

- The merging of our feature branches required a few in-between fixes to ensure
  a smooth merge into the develop branch.

### Sharing of Information

- The team sought for clarification from the TA regarding the grading scheme of
  Sprint 2, and negotiated the level of effort that was put in Sprint 2 to
  obtain a few points.
